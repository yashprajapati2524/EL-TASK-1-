# Local Network Port Scanning Guide

A hands-on guide to discovering open ports on your local network using Nmap. This project is designed for educational purposes to help you understand your network's exposure and basic security posture.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this exercise is to learn how to discover open ports on various devices (computers, phones, smart TVs, IoT devices, etc.) within your local network. By identifying these open ports, you can begin to understand the services running on your network and assess potential security risks.

## 🛠️ Tools Required

*   **Nmap (Network Mapper)**: An essential, free, and open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing.
    *   **Download**: (https://nmap.org/download.html)
*   **Wireshark (Optional)**: A powerful network protocol analyzer that lets you see what's happening on your network at a microscopic level.

## 📝 Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install Nmap

Download and install Nmap for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) from the official website linked above. The installer will typically add Nmap to your system's PATH, allowing you to run it from any terminal or command prompt.

### Step 2: Find Your Local IP Range

Before you can scan, you need to know what to scan. You must identify the IP address range of your local network.

*   **On Windows:**
    Open Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) and type:
    ```sh
    ipconfig
    ```
    Look for your "Wireless LAN adapter" or "Ethernet adapter". Note the `IPv4 Address` (e.g., `192.168.1.15`) and the `Subnet Mask` (e.g., `255.255.255.0`). A subnet mask of `255.255.255.0` means your network range is `192.168.1.0/24`.

*   **On macOS or Linux:**
    Open a terminal and type:
    ```sh
    ifconfig
    # or a more modern command:
    ip a
    ```
    Look for your active network interface (e.g., `en0` on Mac, `eth0` or `wlan0` on Linux). Find the `inet` address. If your IP is `192.168.1.15`, your network range is likely `192.168.1.0/24`. The `/24` is CIDR notation for the `255.255.255.0` subnet mask and means Nmap will scan all 256 addresses in that range (from `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.255`).

### Step 3: Run the Nmap Scan

Now, run the Nmap scan. We will use the `-sS` flag, which performs a TCP SYN scan (also known as a "half-open" or "stealth" scan). It's fast and less likely to be logged by target systems.

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command, **replacing `192.168.1.0/24` with your actual network range**.

```sh
nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
```
Nmap will now send packets to every potential host on your network and report back which hosts are up and which of their ports are open. This may take a few minutes.
